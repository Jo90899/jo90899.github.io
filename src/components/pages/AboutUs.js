                    <ul className="body-inner-text">Gather is a site designed to help you optimize meet-ups and get-togethers. The idea is to help you or other members of your group find rides without the hassle. It's as simple as telling us where you are meeting and handle the rest. </ul>
                    <h1 className="body-title-text">Meet the CEO</h1>
                    <ul className="body-inner-text">Our founder, Joseph Abdelmalek, has always been known by many names. The most notable of them is "the DD," or "the Designated Dad." He is always the first to handle the logistics of any gathering. Time and place? On it. Snacks? Check the first pocket of his backpack. Oh, are you cold? Grab the extra hoodie from the trunk of his car. And the blanket too!</ul>
                    <ul className="body-inner-text">One of the other reasons for this absurdly accurate nicknames is his service as the friend group's "friendly neighborhood free-of-charge chauffer." When someone needs a ride, they can always ask Joseph. Now, it is not always smooth sailing (or driving). Organizing rides gets tricky when larger numbers of people are involved. In one instance, Joseph had to pull out a map, draw out everyone's location, and figure out the best way for people to meet up.</ul>
                    <ul className="body-inner-text">And that's how Gather was born...</ul>
